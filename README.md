# Basic-Bot
Here's a simple bot to start with!
To get started you'll need to install couple of things such as:
Node.js click [here](https://node.js.org) to get it.
Visual Studio Code click [here](https://code.visualstudio.com) to get it.

Now that you installed the said apps you will need to create a file called "config.json".
